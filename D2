Project Deadline 2 

We are using the libgdx to make the basic flow of the angry birds game . Basic Flow here means just the clickable prototype. The workable prototype is required for deadline 3. 
LigGdX setup was done on 15 Oct. 
Project name - AngryBirds 

Basic layout is as follows 
- Loading Screen

- MainMenu Screen - Start Game, Load Game, ViewmyFlock, Exit buttons are there in the MainMenu
  - Start Game button leads to ->
    SelectLevel Screen - Level 1, Level 2, Level 3 ( for this deadline only im pointing all the levels to one screen )
  - Load Game button leads to - >
    LoadGame Screen - User can load the previously loaded Game
  - ViewMyFlock button leads to -> 
    BirdFamily Screen - Contains info about birds - names , powers 
  - Exit button exits the game

- Selecting a level from the SelectLevel Screen will lead the the MainGame Screen
  - It has background
  - Catapult at the left 
  - The bird on the catapult
  - Below it is the bird set ( user can choose any bird but after launching he/she cant use the same bird twice unless some extra card is awarded according to the points. This feature is extra, i might or might not include it )
  - After some distance is the Structure -> Structure is the combination of Blocks and Pigs ( Wood, Glass, Stone, TNT )

 - MainGame Screen has the Pause button at the top right. It will lead to ->
   -  PauseScreen - Save Game Button , Exit Button ( Leads to the MainMenu ), Resume Button

 - Win Screen ->
   - If all the Pigs are finished ( This might not be implemented since the game is not workable )
